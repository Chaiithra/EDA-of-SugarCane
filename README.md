DATA ANALYSIS OF SUGARCANE PRODUCTION:    

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook which has the code for the analysis of Sugarcane Production.
It uses Python whose libraries include Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn.

DATASET:     

The dataset used here is "List of Countries by Sugarcane Production.csv" which is available in this repository.                                       
It contains the following features:  

1.Country                                                                                                            
2.Continent 

3.Production (Tons)	                                                                                                 
4.Production per Person (Kg)                                                                                                                    

5.Acreage (Hectare)                                                                                                         
6.Yield (Kg / Hectare)                                                                                                          


DATA CLEANING:  

We rename columns, and do some preprocessing such as changing the data types to flexible ones,removing or replacing commas or periods.
We also handle null values and outliers.

UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS:

Here, we analyze each column separately and visualize them using bar graphs, pie charts and distribution plots.

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS:

Here, we analyze and visualize the relationships between two variables / features. Scatter plots and bar plots are used here to visualize these relationships.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS:

The correlation analysis investigates the relationships between numerical variables. A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation matrix and identify any significant correlations.

ANALYSIS BY CONTINENT:

The analysis is also conducted at the continent level to understand how production and other variables vary across different continents. Bar plots and line plots are used to visualize these comparisons.

CONCLUSION:

This analysis provides insights into sugarcane production across different countries and continents. It explores the relationship between various production-related metrics and uncovers patterns and trends within the dataset.
